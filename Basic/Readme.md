<h1> 03. Python Indentation </h1>
<p>Python indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line, which are used to define the structure and flow of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or parentheses to define code blocks, Python uses indentation to specify the grouping of statements. </p>

<p>For example, consider the following code snippet:</p>

<pre>
age = 13
if age >= 13:
    print("He is a boy")
else:
    print("She is a girl")
</pre>

<p>In this code, indentation is important. The `if` and `else` blocks must have an indented line for the code to be considered part of their respective blocks. Without proper indentation, you will encounter an "IndentationError." </p>

<h1> 05. Python Variables </h1>
<p>Variables are container for storing data values </p>
<p>Python has no command for declaring a variable</p>
<p> A variable is Create  wehn we  just assign the moment we assign value to it <p/>
<p>For example, consider the following code snippet:</p>

<pre>
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
</pre>

<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set </p>

<h3> Python- variable Names</h3>

<p> A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age,carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables: 

<pre>
myvar = "john" #it can be written down using all the small letter
my_var = "john" #it Can be written down by underscore to eliminate the gap
_my_var = "john" #it can be written down using first and middle underscore
MYVAR = "john" #it can be written down with all the capital letter 
MYVAR = "john" #it can be written down with  all the capital letter
myvar2 = "john"
</pre>
